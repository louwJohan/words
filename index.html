            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Welcome to our website, it is designed specifically to help kids improve their vocabulary and
                language skills!

                We understand the importance of building a strong foundation of language skills in children, and that's
                why we've created this website to make learning fun and engaging. Our website uses the proven technique
                of "word flashing" to help kids memorize and retain new words in a quick and efficient way.</p> <br>

               <p> Through our interactive platform, kids will be presented with a variety of words in a fast-paced,
                flashing format that is both stimulating and memorable. As a parent you can add the words your child
                is struggeling with and set the time period the word is displayed

                Additionally, our platform is accessible on all devices, making it easy for kids to practice their
                vocabulary skills anytime, anywhere. We believe that learning should be a fun and rewarding experience for kids, and that's why we've
                designed our website to be a user-friendly and engaging tool for parents, teachers, and students alike.
                
                Thank you for visiting our website, and we hope you enjoy it!</p>
